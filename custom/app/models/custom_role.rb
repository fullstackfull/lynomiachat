# Available permissions for custom roles:
# - 'conversation_manage': Can manage all conversations.
# - 'conversation_unassigned_manage': Can manage unassigned conversations and assign to self.
# - 'conversation_participating_manage': Can manage conversations they are participating in (assigned to or a participant).
# - 'contact_manage': Can manage contacts.
# - 'report_manage': Can manage reports.
# - 'knowledge_base_manage': Can manage knowledge base portals.
# - 'commerce_order_manage': Lynomia Commerce: can change store order statuses and resend store emails (refunds and
#   cancellations stay administrator-only).
# - 'support_ticket_manage': Lynomia Support: can see and work every support case in the account. Without it an
#   agent sees only the cases assigned to them or to one of their teams (custom/app/policies/support/ticket_policy.rb).

# Lynomia-owned: `commerce_order_manage` below is what lets a non-administrator act on a store order
# (custom/app/policies/commerce/action_policy.rb), so the role storage is Lynomia's, on the
# custom_roles table that ships in the OSS schema (db/schema.rb).
